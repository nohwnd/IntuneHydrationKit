# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Linux baseline hydration**: Added bundled Linux compliance and configuration script templates.
- **TUI**: Header now shows the current module version.

### Fixed

- **Linux scripts**: Import Linux scripts as configuration policies instead of macOS shell scripts.
- **Delete safety**: Platform-scoped delete now skips workloads outside the selected platform and platform-neutral workloads during platform-specific deletes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Device Filters**: Added Windows architecture assignment filters for x64, ARM64, and x86 devices using Intune's native `device.cpuArchitecture` property.
- **Device Filters**: Added macOS architecture assignment filters for Apple Silicon and Intel devices using Intune's native `device.cpuArchitecture` property.
- **Template contracts**: Added coverage for bundled dynamic group and device filter templates, including architecture filter rule validation.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Mobile Apps**: Fixed user-scope WinGet app installs for standard users by preferring the signed-in user's WinGet executable and avoiding SYSTEM bootstrap attempts in user context.
- **WinGet logging**: Generated WinGet install, uninstall, and remediation scripts now fall back to user-writable log folders when the Intune Management Extension log directory is not writable.
- **Template contracts**: Added coverage to keep user-scope WinGet templates aligned with `install.experience = user`, `--scope user`, and Graph `runAsAccount = user`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Interactive TUI**: Added a zero-argument `Invoke-IntuneHydration` console wizard for Azure cloud, operation mode, workload targets, platform filtering, optional Graph consent prompting, verbose logging, and final confirmation. The tenant ID is discovered after browser sign-in.
- **Dry-run first workflow**: Added a TUI dry-run create mode and review screen before Graph write calls.
- **TUI documentation and media**: Updated README/help docs, screenshot, demo capture, and VHS source files for the guided console experience.

### Changed

- **Default invocation**: Bare module and repository-wrapper invocation now launch the TUI; settings-file and parameter-based automation modes remain available.
- **Execution settings**: TUI selections now resolve through the same execution settings shape as parameter and settings-file runs.
- **Common parameter handling**: `-WhatIf` and `-Verbose` now flow into TUI review and execution settings.
- **Wrapper parity**: The repository wrapper now matches the module command parameter surface, including `-StaticGroups`, `-MobileApps`, `-CISBaselines`, and `-Platform`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Authentication**: Added a themed browser PKCE interactive sign-in flow.
- **Mobile Apps**: Added bundled WinGet app templates and WinGet-backed Win32 app import support under the Mobile Apps workflow.
- **Pre-flight checks**: Added selected-workload access probing for Device Filters.

### Changed

- **Authentication**: Interactive auth retries with a fresh browser token and does not persist refresh tokens.
- **Runtime permission checks**: Added selected-import access checks and clearer Global Administrator guidance for tenants where PIM-elevated roles may not be accepted by downstream Intune authorization.
- **Sovereign clouds**: Centralized Graph environment metadata for consistent GCC High and DoD endpoint handling.

### Fixed

- **Mobile Apps**: Fixed new mobile app names to append ` - [IHD]` after the app name instead of prefixing `[IHD]`.
- **Mobile Apps**: Fixed legacy Windows `TemplateId` matching for nested Store and M365 templates.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **OpenIntuneBaseline**: Updated to windows-v3.8.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Minor bug fixes and enhancements**: Included smaller reliability fixes and import-path improvements across CIS and related baseline workflows.

### Changed

- **CIS baseline coverage**: Added a substantial amount of new bundled CIS baseline templates across supported policy categories.
- **General maintainability**: Included additional workflow and code-quality enhancements throughout the hydration process.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Bundled Baselines by Default**: OpenIntuneBaseline policies now always import from the bundled `Templates/OpenIntuneBaseline/` directory instead of downloading from GitHub. Removed `BaselineRepoUrl`, `BaselineBranch`, and `BaselineDownloadPath` parameters from `Invoke-IntuneHydration` and the wrapper script. The `openIntuneBaseline` configuration section has been removed from the settings schema and example files. `Get-OpenIntuneBaseline` remains available as a standalone utility for manual downloads, and `Import-IntuneBaseline -BaselinePath` still accepts a custom path override.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Retry-After Header Support**: `Invoke-GraphBatchOperation` now captures `Retry-After` headers from individual 429/503 batch responses and honors the longest delay before retrying, falling back to exponential backoff when the header is absent
- **Paginated Query Retry Logic**: `Get-GraphPagedResults` now retries on 429/5xx transient errors with Retry-After support and exponential backoff (max 3 retries per page)
- **`[OutputType()]` Annotations**: Added to 8 private helpers: `Get-FilteredTemplates`, `Get-GraphErrorMessage`, `Get-HydrationTemplates`, `Get-ResultSummary`, `New-HydrationDescription`, `New-HydrationResult`, `Remove-ReadOnlyGraphProperties`, `Test-HydrationKitObject`
- **Comment-Based Help**: Completed `.DESCRIPTION` and `.EXAMPLE` sections for `Write-HydrationLog`, `Initialize-HydrationLogging`, and `Import-HydrationSettings`
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded from 458 to 648 tests (+190) with 13 new test files:
  - 9 private function tests: `Get-GraphErrorMessage`, `Get-HydrationTemplates`, `Get-ObfuscatedTenantId`, `Get-PremiumP2ServicePlans`, `Get-ResultSummary`, `New-HydrationResult`, `Remove-ReadOnlyGraphProperties`, `Test-ConditionalAccessPolicyRequiresP2`, `Test-ConditionalAccessPolicyRequiresPreview`
  - 4 public function tests: `Import-IntuneBaseline`, `Import-IntuneAppProtectionPolicy`, `Import-IntuneConditionalAccessPolicy`, `Import-IntuneNotificationTemplate`
  - 429 throttle with Retry-After header test for `Invoke-GraphBatchOperation`

### Changed

- **Error Handling**: Replaced bare `throw` and `Write-Error` with `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()` and `$PSCmdlet.WriteError()` in 9 public functions (`Connect-IntuneHydration`, `Get-OpenIntuneBaseline`, `Import-HydrationSettings`, `Import-IntuneBaseline`, `Import-IntuneConditionalAccessPolicy`, `Import-IntuneEnrollmentProfile`, `Invoke-IntuneHydration`, `New-IntuneDynamicGroup`, `Test-IntunePrerequisites`) - all errors now include structured ErrorRecord objects with error IDs, categories, and target objects
- **Graph API Performance**: Added `$select` query parameter to 8+ GET requests across `Import-IntuneCompliancePolicy`, `Import-IntuneConditionalAccessPolicy`, `Import-IntuneEnrollmentProfile`, `Test-IntunePrerequisites`, and `Test-WindowsDriverUpdateLicense` to reduce response payload size
- **Centralized Hydration Marker**: Marker strings (`"Imported by Intune Hydration Kit"` and hyphenated variant) consolidated into `$script:HydrationMarker` and `$script:HydrationMarkerAlt` module-scoped variables in `IntuneHydrationKit.psm1`, used by `Test-HydrationKitObject` and `New-HydrationDescription`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **`[IHD]` Name Prefix**: All imported objects are now prefixed with `[IHD]` for easy identification and filtering in the Intune portal
- **Batch Graph API Operations**: Groups, policies, filters, and apps now use batched API calls (up to 10 per batch) for significantly faster execution (~61% improvement)
- **Bundled OpenIntuneBaseline Templates**: OIB templates are now included in the module - no external download required at runtime
- **Notification Template Support**: Import and delete notification message templates (`Templates/Notifications/`)

### Changed

- **Performance**: Full hydration runs reduced from ~180s to ~70s via batch operations
- Delete mode now identifies objects by both `[IHD]` name prefix and description marker for more reliable matching
- `Get-TemplateDisplayNames` returns `HashSet[string]` (case-insensitive) instead of plain collection - help text updated to match
- `Import-IntuneMobileApp` now uses `-Notes` parameter (instead of `-Description`) for mobile app notes field
- Security Baselines count corrected from 91 to 94

### Fixed

- **Delete mode**: Graph API duplicate key error when listing groups (`displayName` dictionary collision)
- **Delete mode**: Null-valued expression errors when `$response.value` is null or empty
- **Delete mode**: Scriptblock scope bug where `$results += $item` created a new local variable instead of accumulating
- **Delete mode**: `Get-TemplateDisplayNames` returned empty `HashSet` that PowerShell enumerated to `$null`; fixed with comma operator
- **Delete mode**: Baseline path resolution was inside create-only conditional block; moved outside
- **Delete mode**: Notification template prefix-stripping for name matching
- **Batch operations**: Empty batch responses now correctly marked as Failed instead of assumed success
- **Batch operations**: Added bounds check and TryParse for batch response ID mapping to prevent null dereference
- **Batch operations**: `Get-GraphPagedResults` uses `List[object]` instead of O(n²) array reallocation for paging
- **Group delete safety**: Template-scoped deletes via `-KnownNames` parameter - only groups matching current templates are deleted
- **Group batch import**: Null-safe prefix resolution defaults to `[IHD] `, including the trailing space, when `$script:ImportPrefix` is null (dot-source safety)
- **Enrollment profiles**: Dashes stripped only from original description text, not from hydration tag; uses space separator via `New-HydrationDescription -Separator ' '`
- **JSON template parsing**: Malformed group template files no longer crash the entire hydration run (per-file try/catch)
- **Group prefix mismatch**: Existence check now queries both prefixed and unprefixed names, preventing duplicate creation on re-runs
- **Cross-platform paths**: `Import-IntuneBaseline` uses chained `Join-Path` calls instead of Windows-style backslash separators
- **Hardcoded prefix regex**: All 9 delete-matching regex patterns now use `[regex]::Escape()` for dynamic prefix support
- **Description helper consistency**: `Import-IntuneCompliancePolicy` and `Invoke-GroupBatchImport` now use `New-HydrationDescription` instead of manual concatenation
- **Whitespace handling**: `New-HydrationDescription` uses `[string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace()` instead of truthy check
- **Cross-platform tests**: `Get-FilteredTemplates` path splitting now uses `[/\\]` regex instead of OS-native separator
- **CI pipeline**: Pinned GitHub Actions to specific versions, added `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` env var
- **LICENSE file**: Restored to git tracking (was accidentally deleted from feature branch)

## [0.3.4] - 2026-01-17

  - New enrollment profile template: Windows Autopilot device preparation - User Driven
  - New static group: Windows Autopilot device preparation (with Intune Provisioning Client as owner)

  - Log files are always written regardless of WhatIf mode
  - Summary reports (both Markdown and JSON) are always generated
  - Report mode correctly displays "Dry-Run" when WhatIf is enabled
- **Issue #13**: TenantId parameter consistency across functions
  - Both `Connect-IntuneHydration` and `Invoke-IntuneHydration` now require GUID format
  - Documentation and examples updated to reflect GUID-only requirement
- Tenant ID obfuscation in console output for security (e.g., `0e3028c5****-****-****-eea5ff7417b5`)
